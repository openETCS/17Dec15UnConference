# 17Dec15UnConference

Dear all,

it took us about 5 years from the very beginning of first registration to the ITEA website up to the very moment that we will have finalized the openETCS@ITEA project with the final official ITEA review on December 16. Since that review is not public, we cannot invite guests or interested parties to this event. However the day after we have planned such public event for everyone who is interested in the openETCS idea, technology or legal framework and how this concept may or may not  effect your business.

In order to make this event as convenient and effective as possible we are planning to go away from the usual conference format with invited papers, fixed agendas and talks selected by an "elite" rather than the general public or audience.  We are using a format that is quite different from conventional workshops or conferences. It is known as "Un-Conference" or "Bar-Camp" and makes mostly use of self organization of the conference participants, making them active contributors instead of passive receptors.

We, that is ProjectOffice (ProjectOffice@openETCS.org) takes care of all the organizational framework, rooms, catering, etc. and you, the participants take care of the contributions, that is: talks, presentations, discussions, demos and whatever people may be interested in. If you have never participated in such "Un-Conference" please take a look at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference

If you are interested in such event, please indicate your participation for the entire time (Thursday and Friday) or a part of it in our doodle:

If you are interested to contribute one way or the other, then please utilize our Wiki on or openETCS@GitHub repository:
